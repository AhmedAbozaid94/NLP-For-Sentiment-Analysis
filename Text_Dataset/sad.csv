emotional pain will always hu more than physical pain,sad
my silence is just another word for my pain,sad
sometimes tears are a sign of unspoken happiness and smile is a sign of silenced pain,sad
the pain is there to remind me that im still alive,sad
i know my silence and my tears will heal my pain one day,sad
missing you can turn from pain to pleasure if i knew you were missing me too,sad
the most painful goodbyes are those which were never said and never explained,sad
love cant be proven with poems promises or presents sometimes only pain and patience can prove it,sad
the greatest pain that comes from love is loving someone you can never have,sad
yes ive changed pain does that to people,sad
it hus but its okay because we cant force someone to feel the same as well we feel for them,sad
dont be much closer to anybody because a small change in their behavior hus a lot,sad

hu me with the truth but dont comfo me with a lie,sad
if you can go days without talking to me i am obviously not that impoant to you,sad
you can close your eyes to the things you dont want to see but you cant close your hea to the things you dont want to feel,sad
some guys just dont realize how much one little thing can hu a girl,sad
promises are worse than lies because you dont just make them believe you also make them hope,sad
perfect maturity is when a person hus you and you try to understand their siuation and dont hu them back,sad
it hus when you realize you arent as impoant to someone as you thought you were,sad
sometimes im not angry im hu and theres a big difference,sad
dont ask why someone keep huing you ask yourself why youre allowing them,sad
love is like a rubber band held at both ends of two people when one leaves it hus the other,sad
love always hus,sad
nothing hus more than realizing he meant everything to you but you meant nothing to him,sad
i wish i could give you my pain just for one moment not to hu you but rather so you can finally understand how much you hu me,sad
dont trust too much dont hope too much because that too much can hu you so much,sad
erase the messages delete the numbers and move on you dont have to forget them just accept that they arent that person anymore,sad
sometimes youre not in love you just care too much to let go because you dont want to hu them,sad
you only get hu if you actually give a fuck,sad
love is like heavenbut it hus like hell,sad
sometimes i wish i had the guts to hu you like you hu me but even if i had the chance i wouldnt take it,sad
i hope youll realize how much youre huing me someday,sad
time doesnt really heal a hea it just makes the hea forget about the pain,sad
sometimes its better to be alone nobody can hu you,sad
you fall in love you get hu thats life,sad
the deepest people are the ones whove been hu the most,sad
forget who hu you yesterday but dont forget who loves you tenderly today,sad
getting hu doesnt make me stupid it means i have enough hope and enough love in my hea to always think the best of people,sad
the only ones that can truly hu you deeply are the ones you love,sad
nothing hus more than realizing he was everything to you and you were nothing,sad
what hus you today makes you stronger tomorrow,sad
the hardest thing to do is watch the one you love love someone else,sad
one day youll realizeall the love that i gave to youis now being given to someone else,sad
silent people have the greatest hea,sad
when youre happy you enjoy the music but when youre sad you understand lyrics,sad
i get jealous because i am afraid someone is going to make you happier than i do,sad
sometimes you need to run away just to see who will follow you,sad
if you a girl make laugh she likes you but if you make her cry she loves you,sad
your emotions trouble you only in those things which you call yours,sad
when you can tell your story and it doesnt make you cry thats when you know youve healed,sad
never assume that someone likes you by their sweetness sometimes youre just an option when theyre bored,sad
you arent wohy of her silence if you cant respect her feelings,sad
we all get addicted to something that takes away the pain,sad
dear feelings i need you to move on,sad
no one stays with you permanently so learn to survive alone,sad

i understand why you left but what i dont understand why im still waiting for you,sad

never depend on others too much because someday you will have to walk alone,sad
its hard to forget someone who gave you so much to remember,sad
its better to just quietly miss someone rather than let them know and just get no response,sad
there are billions of people in this world but sometimes you really need just one,sad
i never feel alone bcz loneliness is always with me,sad
sometimes i pretend that i dont care but really i care more than anyone else ever will,sad
no matter how hard you try some people will never change,sad
im the type of girl who smiles to make everyones day even though im dying inside,sad
when you sit alone you sit with your past,sad
i am scared of getting too close to anyone because those who said that they will always be there for me,sad
people who are always online are the loneliest agree,sad
i dont care who was before me as long as i know there is nobody during me,sad
i hope you will always remember all the great memories we created because i will,sad
we may forget the person but memories stay there forever,sad
just because we are not close anymore doesnt mean i dont care about you,sad
missing someone is a pa of loving them if you are never apa then you will never know how strong your love really is,sad
loneliness is better than a bad company,sad
you told me i was perfect but you still left i should have known my perfect wouldnt be good enough,sad
dont cry over someone who wouldnt cry over you,sad
when she ignores you thats when you need to talk to her the most,sad
sorry isnt always enough sometimes you actually have to change,sad
once upon a time i was stupid enough to fall in love with you,sad
walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light,sad
every time you ignore me i regret every text message that i have ever sent you,sad
sometimes i hate getting close to people because i think they will just walk out of my life no matter how close we are,sad
some days i cant stop thinking about you and other days i wonder why i am wasting my time,sad
some things will never go back to the way they used to be no matter how much you miss them,sad
cheating is a choice not a mistake,sad
people always cheated mebecause i loved them like mad,sad
i just want an honest relationship no lies no mind games no cheating,sad
alphabets in teaching cheating are common those who try cheat u often teach,sad
